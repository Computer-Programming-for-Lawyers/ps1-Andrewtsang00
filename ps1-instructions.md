# Problem Set 1 Instructions
If you've gotten here, you should feel highly accomplished. Particularly for those new to programming, sometimes just getting the infrastructure set up is the hardest part.

## Problem Set 1: Print "Hello, World!"
Your first problem set is one of the most well-known programming tasks there is. The goal is to write a simple program that prints **"Hello, World!"**

### Step 1: Create a Jupyter Notebook
Before we start coding, we need to create a file in which to write the code. We'll be using what are called **Jupyter Notebooks** to program this semester. A Jupyter Notebook allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It's a powerful tool commonly used in data science, machine learning, and academic research for its interactive nature.

To create a new notebook, we'll use the terminal again. Type the following in your terminal to create a new notebook: ```touch ps1.ipynb```

Once you do that, you should see "ps1.ipynb" in the file explorer on the left-hand side of your screen. You may need to go between this file and that file while you're coding. The file you're reading now is called "ps1-instructions.md" and you can access it through the tabs along the top of your screen, or through the file explorer.

### Step 2: Open File and Print "Hello, World!"
Once you've created the ps1.ipynb file, find and click on the file in your file terminal. That should open a blank Jupyter Notebook. Once that's open, your goal is to print the words "Hello, World!" exactly. You are welcome to consult online resources, but I recommend trying on your own first. 

#### Tip: Select Kernel

In order to start coding, you have to [select a Kernel](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-kernel-management) in the top right of your screen. Kernels execute the code you write. Follow the recommended steps as prompted by Codespaces, you can see what that might look like here:

You may also have to install and enable Python and Jupyter Notebook, as prompted by Codespaces.

### Step 3: Submit Assignment
Once you've completed the assignment, we'll practice "pushing" changes as a means of submitting your assignment. Back in the terminal again, do the following:

#### Type ```git add .``` to add all changes to the list of updates to make.
#### Type ```git commit -m "submit assignment"``` to indicate what changes you've made
#### Type ```git push``` to save the changes you've made.

> [!TIP]
> GitHub Classroom is a bit odd and doesn't have a formal "submit" button. We have access to your progress, so don't worry about work getting lost. But once you follow the below steps, we'll consider your assignment officially submitted.
